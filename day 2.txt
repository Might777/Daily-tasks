#Q1Using input() function take one number from the user and using ternary operators

# Prompt the user for a number and check if it's even or odd
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
result = "Even" if number % 2 == 0 else "Odd"
print(f"The number {number} is {result}.")

#Q2
# Prompt the user for two numbers
first_number = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
second_number = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Swap the numbers
first_number, second_number = second_number, first_number

# Display the swapped values
print(f"After swapping: First number = {first_number}, Second number = {second_number}")



#Q3
#Write a Program to Convert Kilometers to Miles

# Prompt the user to enter a distance in kilometers
kilometers = float(input("Enter the distance in kilometers: "))

# Conversion factor from kilometers to miles
conversion_factor = 0.621371

# Convert to miles
miles = kilometers * conversion_factor

# Display the result
print(f"{kilometers} kilometers is equal to {miles:.2f} miles.")


#Q4
#Find the Simple Interest on Rs. 200 for 5 years at 5% per year.

# Define the principal amount, time period, and annual interest rate
principal_amount = 200  # in rupees
time_period = 5         # in years
annual_rate = 5         # as a percentage

# Calculate simple interest
simple_interest = (principal_amount * time_period * annual_rate) / 100

# Display the result
print(f"The Simple Interest on Rs. {principal_amount} for {time_period} years at {annual_rate}% per year is Rs. {simple_interest}.")
